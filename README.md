# SQL Server 2019 Always On Cluster

This demo deploys the necessary Azure Virtual Machine resources, to run a SQL Qlways-On Cluster in an ADDS Domain. There is also an additional Management Workstation with SQL Server Management Studio.  

## ⬇️ Installation
- [Azure Developer CLI - AZD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
    - When installing AZD, the above the following tools will be installed on your machine as well, if not already installed:
        - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)
        - [Bicep CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)
    - You need Owner or Contributor access permissions to an Azure Subscription to  deploy the scenario.

## 🚀 Cloning the scenario in 4 steps:

1. Create a new folder on your machine.
```
mkdir tdd-azd-starter
```
2. Next, navigate to the new folder.
```
cd tdd-azd-starter
```
3. Next, run `azd init` to initialize the deployment.
```
azd init -t petender/tdd-azd-sqlao
```
4. Copy the starter template into its own directory and modify the template.
```
Update the main.bicep and resources.bicep with your own resource information
```
5. Update the azure.yaml metadata
```
Update the name and metadata.template parameters in the azure.yaml, with your preferred scenario name, e.g. tdd-azd-trafficmgr
```

## 🚀 Push the scenario to your own GitHub:

1. Sync the new scenario you created into your own GitHub account into a public repo, using the same name as what you specified in the azure.yaml

2. Once available, add the necessary "additional demo scenario artifacts" (demoguide.md, demoguide screenshots, scenario architecture diagram,...) 

3. With all template details and demo artifacts available in the repo, follow the steps on how to [Contribute](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/trainer-demo-deploy/docs/contribute) to Trainer-Demo-Deploy, to get your scenario published into the catalog.
